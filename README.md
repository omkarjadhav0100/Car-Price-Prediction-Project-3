# Car-Price-Prediction-Project-3
In this project, we study the data of Uber which is present in tabular format in which we use different libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib and different machine learning algorithms.
We study different columns of the table and try to co-relate them with others and find a relation between those two.
We try to find and analyze those key factors like date, month etc which helps Uber Company to enhance their business by focusing on those services and make required changes.
